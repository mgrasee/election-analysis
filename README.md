## Challenge Summary:

This script was very effective at determining the results of this multi-county election. However, if some modifications it could be used for other elections data as well. For instance, we would want to include a State/Territory analysis as well as possibly a Country analysis. By doing so, we could effectively use this script for numerous elections results.
